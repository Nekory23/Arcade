# Arcade
{EPITECH} | Second year | Object-Oriented programming

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.

To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.
Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main program.
